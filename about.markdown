I am a Ph.D Student studying American Religious History and Bioethics in the Religious Studies Dept. at Florida State University. My particular areas of interest are the relationships between religion, geography, emotions, and disease. I also am pursuing the Graduate Certificate in Bioethics from the Philosophy Dept. I also teach Introduction to World Religions.
